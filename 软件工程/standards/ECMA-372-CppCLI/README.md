# ECMA-372 C++/CLI

This Standard specifies requirements for implementations of the C++/CLI binding. The first such requirement is that they implement the binding, and so this Standard also defines C++/CLI. Other requirements and relaxations of the first requirement appear at various places within this Standard.

C++/CLI is an extension of the C++ programming language as described in ISO/IEC 14882:2003, Programming languages â€” C++. In addition to the facilities provided by C++, C++/CLI provides additional keywords, classes, exceptions, namespaces, and library facilities, as well as garbage collection.
